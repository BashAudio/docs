## Protect Developer Credentials
- Limit and manage access to your Mufi Dashboard and API tokens.
- Set up a time-based one-time password (e.g., Google Authenticator) for accessing the your Mufi dashboard and features.

## Secure Storage of Mufi API keys
- Store Mufi API tokens securely and minimize access to these credentials.
- They should only be used on the backend and never shared on the client side.

## JWT Length and Storage
- When the JWT expires a user’s session ends (user is logged out) so they will have to re-authenticate once it expires. The JWT token has a maximum lifetime of 30 days. Configure this to the shortest acceptable time to balance security and user experience.
- Never save or log user JWTs.

## Mitigate XSS Attacks
- Use content security policies on the frontend.
- Implement TLS and HTTPS for all requests.
- Limit permissible JavaScript, set context headers properly, and avoid open redirects.
- If you enable the frame-src CSP, then you need to perform this whitelisting (learn how here).
- Enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP). Refer to this guide for more information.

## Enhance CORS Security
- Add specific origins for CORS to protect your environment from unauthorized websites using your public environment key.
- Avoid using wildcards in favor of explicit domains.
- Be especially strict with your live environment (e.g don’t have localhost etc)

## Addressing Potential Risks - internal employee account accessed
If an employee account is compromised and best practices are not followed, there are several risks:

- Unauthorized activities could be conducted using acquired JWT and session key.
