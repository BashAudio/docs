The Mufi Wallet API is a RESTful API that allows you to interact with the Mufi Wallet. It enables you to easily create custodial wallets on the Polkadot Network paired with user email addresses.
These wallets are secure, easy to use, and allow you to interact with web3 applications and services in a web2 flow. 

Simply follow the below steps to enable your project to support these wallets.
