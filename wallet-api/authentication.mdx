The Mufi API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication to ensure that only authorized clients can access the Gateway API, adding an additional layer of security against unauthorized access.

## Getting your Mufi API Credentials
We are currently in the proccess of releasing our Alpha version in the upcoming weeks. If you are interested in joining our Alpha program, please 
contact us via the [Get Started](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) button on the top right of the page or email us at [connect@mufi.app](mailto:connect@mufi.app).

## JWT Tips
- When the JWT expires a userâ€™s session ends (user is logged out) so they will have to re-authenticate once it expires. 
- The JWT token generated by the [Get Auth Token](/wallet-api/endpoint/auth) endpoint has a maximum lifetime of 1 hour.
- The JWT token has a maximum lifetime of 7 days via the [Refresh Auth Token](/wallet-api/endpoint/refreshAuth) endpoint.
- Never share your JWT credentials with anyone.
